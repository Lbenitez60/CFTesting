        <p>
            I have three main activities that I do after school every week. On Mondays and Thursdays I go to Model UN. I didn't do Model UN last year, so this year is my first. I have gone to a bunch of conferences in different places, and at the time of writing this the next one will be NHSMUN from March 8-11. On Fridays I have piano lessons, which I have been doing for many years (I'm still not that good at Piano though). On Tuesdays I go to Roosevelt Island for tennis practice. You can learn more about that in the tennis section under Activities.
