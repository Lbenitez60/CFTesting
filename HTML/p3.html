            I am not that good at skiing, but I still enjoy it a lot. I skied almost every winter as a kid, and when I was really young my family would go to jack frost, which is a skiing mountain in pennsylvania. That is where I learned how to skii. As I learned how to skii more, we started going to other mountains such as Elk Mountain, Blue Mountain, and Camelback. My mom was able to teach me well because she grew up skiing in the Dolomites. One midwinter break we went skiing in the Dolomites as a family, and I had a lot of fun. Pictures of these places are below.
